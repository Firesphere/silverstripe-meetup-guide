#SilverStripe branding

##Banners
There are some SilverStripe banners availble in Europe and New Zealand which may be able to be couriered or shipped to you for your meetup. Don’t forget, you have to send it to the next meetup! It’s not yours!

Please contact [community@silverstripe.org](mailto:community@silverstripe.org) to be put in contact with the current custodians of these banners.

##T-Shirts
There are some tshirt designs avaialbe which you can use in your local area with a T-Shirt printer (cheaper and more practical than shipping all the way from New Zealand if you are overseas).
