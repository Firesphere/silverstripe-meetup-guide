#Sponsorship

* Don’t be afraid. Call your contacts. 
* Most likely, they’ll be willing to chip in. 
* Every bit of sponsoring is good. 
* Keys/discounts from a big name like [Github](Github contact here?) is just as valuable as hard cash from some unknown company.
* Don’t forget to credit your sponsors in talk introductions, slides etc.
